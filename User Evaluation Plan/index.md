# Title
Choosing a User Evaluation Plan

# Status
Accepted
 
## Context
As part of the project I am required to provide a evaluation plan for potential users of the application/prototype. This requires me to use a method of evaluation to base mine on. I had several methods to choose from including:

- System Usability Scale (SUS)
- Satisfaction Surveys
- First Click Testing

## Decision
I have chosen to evaluate my system using lab-based evaluation and using the system usability scale (SUS).

## Rationale
I have made this decision for several reasons detailed below.
1. Affordability. The system usability scale is a free evaluation plan available online. It does not require purchasing, and so is convenient.
2. Ease of use. The system usability scale is easy to use and implement.
3. Reliable. The system usability has been in use for decades and has been tested through hundreds of research studies.

## Consequences
The system usabaility scale requires some training before implementing.
