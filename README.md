## Project Descripton

The files contained within this repository consist of the decision records I have made as I completed the assessment for the software architecture and design module. Each major decision is acommpanied by a directory, which contains within it a read me file, and an index file which contains the decision record iself. Each decision is presented with several options, and the chosen option is justified with proper rationale.
