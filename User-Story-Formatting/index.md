# Title
User Story Format.

## Status
Accepted.

## Context
I needed to choose a format that would allow me to write out the user stories in a consistent and effective format. I mainly had two choices which were:   

•	Custom-made format.  
•	University provided format.  

## Decision
I chose to use the university provided format.

## Rationale
•	It was well written and effective.  
•	I was given teaching instruction on how to use it.  
•	It saves me time as I do not have to create my own.  

## Consequences
As a result of this decision I can write up the user stories quickly.
