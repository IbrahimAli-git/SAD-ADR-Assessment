# Title
Employing Figma as a design tool for creating my prototype.

## Status
Accepted.

## Context
As a result of choosing to create a wireframe for my prototype, instead of developing a prototype application using code, I needed to choose a suitable design tool which would best support me. There are a number of different options available which I will list below which were available to me before choosing one. These included:

1. Figma
2. Adobe XD
3. LucidChart
4. MockFlow

## Decision
I decided to use Figma as my wireframing tool for creating my prototype.

## Rationale
This decision was based on a number of factors including:
1. Pricing. Figma is free to use for all unlike other wireframing tools and even though this is limited for some users, students can gain access to the full suite of tools simply by applying.
2. Users have access to a large community of downloadable content which ease one's journey in creating a prototype.
3. Figma is great for designing user interfaces which can include anything from static webpages to interactive websites with clickable icons.
4. Figma enables a design to be created for any device (Web, Phone, Tablet, etc).
5. I have already have some experience using Figma and have used it in team projects to build a prototype.

## Consequences
The use of Figma will require some basic training before beginning designing the prototype. Specifically in the creation of user interface components that Figma requires the user to create.
