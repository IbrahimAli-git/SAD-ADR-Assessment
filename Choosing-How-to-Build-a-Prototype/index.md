# Title
Creating a proof of concept/wireframe using a wireframing tool. 
# Status
Accepted
 
## Context

The issue is that for the assessment I must demonstrate a proof of concept which will be used later on for user and architectural evaluations. I have been given two main options to choose from as a way of demonstrating this proof of concept. 
The first option is to demonstrate this through developing an application using code. This would include developing the frontend (UI), as well as the backend, and ensuring the two connect.
The second option is to demonstrate this proof of concept by using a wireframe. A wireframe is a prototype built using a no-code development platform. It allows a user to create user-interactive applications without writing any code. The difference between the two is that wireframing tools such as Figma only allow for the development of the frontend, user interface, but do not support the ability to connect to a backend service, limiting the prototype.

## Decision
I have chosen to develop a prototype as a wireframe, using wireframing tools such as Figma. I have chosen a wireframe as this will allow me to develop an application sufficiently to perform user evaluation. Wireframing tools allow for the creation of detailed frontend applications which allow for user interaction. 

## Consequences
As a result of my decision, it will be easier to build my prototype and I will be able to do so in less time, freeing myself to focus on other aspects of the project. This will however make my user evaluation slightly deficient because of the deficiency in using a wireframe instead of building a full stack application.
