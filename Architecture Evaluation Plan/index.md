# Title
Using Scenario-Based Architecture Analysis (SAAM)

# Status
Accepted
 
## Context
I was tasked with evaluating the architecture I have created as part of the module. I had several valid evaluation techniques to choose from. These included:

- Scenario-Based Architecture Analysis (SAAM)
- Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM)
- Proof of Concept

## Decision
I have chosen to use scenario based evaluation to evaluate the system.

## Rationale
I have made this decision for several reasons detailed below.

- I have used this in class with my lecturers and I have experience using it.
- It can be used to thoroughly evaluate architecture based on real-world scenarios.
- It removes the need to create a proof of concept saving me time.

## Consequences
It may require some training beforehand.
