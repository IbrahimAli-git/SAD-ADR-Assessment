# Title
Executing my diagrams using the draw.io diagramming tool.

## Status
Accepted.

## Context
I needed a tool for designing all my diagrams which included
1. A Domain Model
2. A C4 System Context Diagram
3. A C4 Container Diagram
4. A C4 Component Diagram
5. A C4 Code diagram

I had many options to choose from including:
-	Draw.io
-	Google diagrams
-	LucidChart
-	StarUML
-	Visual Paradigm
## Decision
I decided to use draw.io as my diagramming tool.
## Rationale
I chose to use draw.io for a number of reasons including but not limited to:
1. It is free to use and only requires a google account to access.
2. It is comprehensive in the number of diagrams it supports. I am able to design everything from a UML to a C4 model along with many other different types of diagrams.
3. It contains a comprehensive list of features which includes the vast collection of arrows which links components of diagrams together.
4. I am able to connect it to my google account and therefore maintain a copy in my google drive.
5. I have already used it before and therefore do not need training in learning how to use it.
## Consequences
As a consequnce of using draw.io for diagramming I am able to use one piece of web software for designing all of my diagrams, and so I do not need to learn how to use another diagramming tool. The software however does require some training on how to identify the correct sections for each type of diagram and for each arrow.
