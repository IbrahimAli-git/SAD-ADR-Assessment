# Title
Use Case Description Format.

## Status
Accepted.

## Context
I needed to choose a format that would allow me to write out the use cases in a consistent and effective format. I mainly had two choices:

•	Custom-made format.

•	University taught format.

## Decision
I chose to use the university taught format as it was well written and effective.

## Rationale
• The main reason I chose to use the university taught format is that it is the format which is generally used in software development.   
• I also chose it because I was given teaching instruction on how to use it.   

## Consequences
As a result of this decision I am able to write up my use case descripiton in a quick and efficient manner, due to my prior experience using them. A consequence of this choice is that it will require some basic which training, which of course I have already gained.
