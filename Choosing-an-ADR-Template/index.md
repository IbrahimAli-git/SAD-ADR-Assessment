# Title
Using Lightweight for my ADR template.
## Status
Accepted.
## Context
I need to use a decision-recording template to record the decisions I am making throughout the completion of this project. This grants me a written record of my work which includes both the context and justification. Before beginning writing up any decisions I had made I was tasked with choosing a specific template. There are many options to choose from which include:
* Lightweight ADR
* MADR
* Business Case
## Decision
To use lightweight ADR.
## Rationale
There are a number of reasons why I chose to use lightweight ADR. These include:
1. I was given teaching instruction on using this format and so I already had the required knowledge in using it. This translated well to my own work.
2. The template is simple in it's formatting and does not require much training.
3. Lightweight ADR requires no images or videos which simplifies the content.
## Consequences
As a consequence of this I do not need to create my own and can quickly insert the required data into the provided template. This mean I can log decisions quickly and efficiently. This may require some teaching instructions for those who have never use this form of formatting before.
